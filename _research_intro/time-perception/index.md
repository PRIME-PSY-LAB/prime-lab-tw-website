## Overview

This project examined how **positive emotion, arousal, and approach motivation** jointly
shape human **perceived time**. While many studies report that high-arousal emotional
events “feel longer,” results for positive emotion are surprisingly inconsistent.
Some experiments find that high-arousal positive pictures lengthen perceived time,
others find no effect, and some even show shorter perceived durations. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

The working hypothesis was that these divergent findings are not noise, but reflect
the influence of **approach motivation**. High approach motivation (e.g., wanting to
obtain a reward) tends to narrow attention and make time feel shorter, whereas
high arousal tends to speed up the internal clock and make time feel longer.  
This project tested how these forces interact, using the **Scalar Expectancy Theory
(SET) / pacemaker–accumulator model** as the theoretical framework.

## Methods

### Participants

Across three experiments, undergraduate students from Soochow University
(approximately 30–40 participants per experiment) completed a computerized time-estimation task
for course credit or a small monetary reward. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

### Stimuli

- Pictures were selected from the **International Affective Picture System (IAPS)**.
- Only **positive-valence images** were used, split into:
  - **Low-arousal** positive pictures
  - **High-arousal** positive pictures  
- Valence was matched across the two sets, whereas arousal ratings differed reliably
  (high-arousal > low-arousal). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

### Task and design

Participants viewed pictures for one of eight durations
(400–1800 ms) and produced **verbal estimates** of the perceived duration in milliseconds.  
The core factors were:

- **Arousal**: high vs. low (within-subject)
- **Approach motivation**: high vs. low (between-subject)
- **Presentation order** (between-subject, varied across experiments):
  - Experiment 1: fully **random** mixing of high- and low-arousal pictures
  - Experiment 2: **low → high arousal** in blocked order
  - Experiment 3: **high → low arousal** in blocked order

Approach motivation was manipulated by **reward contingency**:

- **High-approach condition**: participants were told they could obtain some of the
  picture stimuli (or related postcards) as a reward after the experiment.
- **Low-approach condition**: no such expectation was created, though all participants
  later received a small gift so that ethical treatment was identical. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

For each participant and condition, a **linear regression** of estimated time on
physical time was fitted. Within the SET framework:

- The **slope** indexes the **pacemaker rate**.
- The **intercept** reflects the effective **switch / attentional gate**, with more
  negative intercepts indicating more pulse loss.

## Key results

### Experiment 1 – Random presentation

- With randomly interleaved high- and low-arousal pictures, **high-arousal images
  were generally judged as lasting longer than low-arousal ones**, consistent with a
  basic arousal effect.
- Approach motivation did **not** produce a clear main effect on perceived duration.
- In SET terms, arousal modestly affected the **intercept**, but there was
  no robust evidence that pacemaker rate differed across conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

**Interpretation:** Random mixing likely allowed **high-arousal trials to “spill over”**
onto neighboring low-arousal trials through slow emotional recovery, masking the
role of approach motivation.

### Experiment 2 – Blocked order, low → high arousal

- When all **low-arousal** pictures were presented first and **high-arousal** pictures
  later, a clear interaction emerged:
  - In the **low-approach** group, high-arousal pictures produced **longer**
    perceived durations than low-arousal pictures.
  - In the **high-approach** group, this arousal advantage **disappeared**:
    high- and low-arousal pictures were perceived with **similar durations**.
- On average, **high approach motivation shortened perceived time** relative to
  low approach motivation.
- Linear-model analysis showed:
  - Under **high approach**, the pacemaker **slope was reduced**, especially for
    high-arousal pictures.
  - For **low approach**, high arousal increased perceived time mainly by raising
    the **intercept**, consistent with more effective pulse accumulation. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

**Interpretation:** When arousal is cleanly separated in time, **approach motivation
counteracts the lengthening effect of arousal**, largely by slowing the effective
pacemaker rate or increasing pulse loss.

### Experiment 3 – Blocked order, high → low arousal

- With the **opposite order** (high → low arousal), the pattern changed again:
  overall, **high approach motivation led to longer perceived durations**.
- The main effect of arousal was weaker and less stable, but time estimates still
  increased with physical duration.
- Analysis suggested that in this schedule, approach motivation mainly influenced
  the **slope**, with high-approach participants showing a generally **faster
  internal clock** across both arousal levels. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

**Interpretation:** Presenting high-arousal pictures first may recruit emotion
regulation or attentional strategies that alter how subsequent trials are processed.
The contrast between Experiments 2 and 3 highlights the importance of **temporal
context and emotional recovery** when interpreting arousal and motivation effects
on time perception.

## Integrated conclusions

1. **Positive arousal alone** tends to **lengthen perceived time**, but this effect
   is **modulated by approach motivation** and by how trials are ordered.
2. **High approach motivation** can:
   - **Shorten perceived time** (especially when low-arousal trials are encountered
     first), or
   - Under some temporal contexts, **increase** the pacemaker rate and lengthen time.
3. Within the **Scalar Expectancy Theory** framework:
   - Arousal primarily impacts the **pacemaker** and sometimes the **gate**.
   - Approach motivation can operate on **both components**:
     reducing pacemaker speed in high-arousal contexts and increasing pulse
     loss via the attentional gate when arousal is low. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
4. These findings help explain why **positive-emotion studies show inconsistent
   arousal effects**: different experiments implicitly induce different levels of
   approach motivation and use different presentation schedules.

## Methods and equipment

Across experiments, the lab used:

- A desktop computer with precise millisecond timing for stimulus presentation.
- Standard LCD displays and controlled viewing distance in a quiet testing room.
- Keyboard-based numeric input for verbal duration estimates.
- Custom experimental scripts that randomized picture–duration pairings within
  each block.

This project illustrates how **psychophysical timing paradigms** and **emotion
manipulations** can be combined to dissect cognitive mechanisms of time perception.
