I'm delighted to share that I have accepted an offer to join the Department of Psychology at Soochow University (Taipei, Taiwan) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor, starting February 2026. 

I am grateful to my advisors, collaborators, and mentors, and all colleagues who supported my work — and to my family for their encouragement.

I look forward to continuing my research in perceptual psychology, visual science, and image-computable modeling, and to teaching courses on perception, computational modeling, and data analysis. 

If you are a prospective student or collaborator interested in these topics, please get in touch (email: affiliation email is waited for enclosed). 

Thank you to everyone who helped me get here — I’m excited for this next chapter.
