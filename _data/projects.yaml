    This research is supported by a MOST College Student Research Scholarship (2019/08-2020/07), 
    series id is 108-2813-C-031-010-H.
    We investigated how positive emotional arousal and approach motivation
    jointly shape perceived time, using IAPS images and scalar expectancy
    theory to separate pacemaker and attentional-gate mechanisms.
