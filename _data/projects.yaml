  description: >
    We develop a dual-pathway V1–MT style motion model that combines
    trainable motion-energy sensing with graph-based recurrent
    integration. By manipulating material properties of moving objects,
    we test how natural optics drive the emergence of second-order
    motion perception and compare the model’s behaviour with human
    psychophysics and state-of-the-art optical-flow methods.

    This project investigates how physical and mental disorders co-occur
    across populations using a network approach enhanced by a Weighted
    Alternating Least Squares (WALS) algorithm.

    This research is supported by a MOST College Student Research Scholarship (2019/08 to 2020/07), 
    series id is 108-2813-C-031-010-H.
    We investigated how positive emotional arousal and approach motivation jointly
    shape perceived time, using IAPS images and scalar expectancy theory.
